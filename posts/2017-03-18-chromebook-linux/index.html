<h1>Chromebook Linux - From Crouton to GalliumOS</h1><time>March 18, 2017</time></header><p>I love my Chromebook (as evidenced in [this](http://{{ site.noita.domain }}/blog/2016/chromebook-web-development/) post); I bring it everywhere as it comes in handy for long commutes and, weighing in at around 3 pounds, isn&rsquo;t the least bit cumbersome.</p>
<p>However, the restrictions ChromeOS placed on me had been noticeable since the beginning; and I knew I would be restricted to Chrome Apps, extensions, and Play store applications, but didn&rsquo;t count on how annoying this restriction would wind up being. Fortunately, there were workarounds.</p>
<h2 id=crouton-an-early-solution>Crouton: An Early Solution</h2>
<p><a href=https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton target=_blank>Crouton</a> proved to be very easy to install and useful from the start. By creating a chroot and installing my distro of choice in it, I could run Ubuntu either by switching over to the chroot or accessing it from the Crosh command line.</p>
<p>There was a problem, however; Ubuntu didn&rsquo;t have the greatest driver support for my Chromebook&rsquo;s trackpad and keyboard. So I found myself running Linux programs from the command line that ChromeOS typically wouldn&rsquo;t allow (such as PHP, Python, and naturally, apt-get), but actually working in the ChromeOS environment, as it was just that much more supportive of the machine (Samsung Chromebook 3).</p>
<p>But now if I wanted to play a game in an emulator such as Mupen64plus or WINE, I could not run that from the command line while in ChromeOS; it would throw an error in regards to X-server, forcing me to switch over to the chroot just for one program.</p>
<h2 id=galliumos-my-current-and-best-so-far-solution>GalliumOS: My Current (And Best, So Far) Solution</h2>
<p>Finally I thought I would consider <a href=https://galliumos.org/ target=_blank>GalliumOS</a>; a distro made specifically for Chromebooks. I made a ChromeOS recovery image and made a GalliumOS bootable USB and gave it a try.</p>
<p>It worked nicely; it was a complete Linux environment that supported my machine&rsquo;s brightness and volume keys, and with better &ldquo;palm detection&rdquo; (think Macbook trackpads and your resting thumb) out of the box without messing about with Synaptics.</p>
<p>Initially, there was no sound support for my model. This stopped from installing it for a bit, but after trying a few other options, one including running a chroot off an SD card (for extra space for packages; it gets ejected when the machine sleeps unfortunately), I figured I&rsquo;d deal with the sound issue. (At the time, the bug was that no internal sound was supported, but Bluetooth sound was.)</p>
<p>After a full install, made easy thanks to GalliumOS&rsquo;s excellent documentation, and then finally a GalliumOS update, to my surprise, internal audio worked, and so I&rsquo;m now using my Chromebook as I please, with the ability to install my favorite programs such as Visual Studio Code (a program I wanted on my Chromebook from the very start), WINE, and all the rest; with that update came the patch that fixed my model&rsquo;s sound issue.</p>
<p>As I find myself installing and re-installing Linux pretty often, as with the example of setting up chroots mentioned earlier, I began tracking my environment&rsquo;s packages, as well as Visual Studio Code extensions, which you can check out in a repository <a href=https://github.com/mattConn/ubuntu-environment-setup target=_blank>here</a>.</p></article>
