<h1>About Matthew Connelly</h1></header><h2 id=what-ive-been-up-to>What I&rsquo;ve Been Up To</h2>
<p>In 2017, I left my job as a Software Developer to pursue a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics, having come from a background in design with a BS in Communications.</p>
<p>Prior to this, I had begun working lower on the stack and had come to the realization that there was a lot that I wanted to understand about Software Development and computers overall. Feeling the time was right, I decided a full dive into Computer Science was necessary at the undergraduate level.</p>

<p>I am now a graduate of the College of Staten Island as of Fall 2020 and I&rsquo;ve come away with a lot, having spent my time enrolled learning how to program using C++ primarily, and discovering a new appreciation for Mathematics, having done an independent study on Differential Geometry.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve read this far, thank you for taking the time, and feel free to drop me a line at matthew.b.connelly at gmail.</p>
